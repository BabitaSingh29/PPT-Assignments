    "K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the data into k folds. The model is then trained on k-1 folds, and evaluated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, and the results are averaged to get an estimate of the model's performance.\n",

    "Stratified k-fold cross-validation is a variation of k-fold cross-validation that ensures that the folds are balanced with respect to the target variable. This is important for preventing overfitting, as it ensures that the model is not trained on too many data points from a single class."
